# DoS Attack Imitation with Python and Selenium

## Overview
This Python script imitates a Denial of Service (DoS) attack by repeatedly sending requests to a target website using Selenium, a web automation tool. This is purely for educational purposes and should not be used for malicious intent.

## Requirements
- Python 3
- Selenium library
- Chrome web browser
- ChromeDriver (automatically installed via WebDriver Manager)

## Installation
1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Install Python 3 if not already installed.
3. Install the required dependencies:
    ```
    pip install selenium webdriver_manager
    ```
4. Ensure you have the Chrome browser installed.

## Usage
1. Open the Python script `dos_attack.py` in a text editor.
2. Modify the following variables according to your requirements:
    - `url`: The URL of the target website.
    - `placeholder_text`: The placeholder text of the input field to locate.
    - `button_text`: The text of the button to locate and click.
    - `iterations`: The number of iterations or requests to be sent.
3. Save the changes.
4. Run the script:
    ```
    python dos_attack.py
    ```
5. Observe the output in the console.

## Important Notes
- Ensure that you have permission to perform tests on the target website. Running this script without authorization may be illegal and unethical.
- This script sends a high volume of requests to the target website, which may cause disruption to its normal operation. Use it responsibly and only on websites that you own or have explicit permission to test.
- Remember that performing DoS attacks on websites without permission is illegal and unethical and can result in severe consequences.
