# DDoS Botnet Simulation Repository

Welcome to the DDoS Botnet Simulation Repository! This repository is created for educational purposes to help individuals learn about DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) botnets and understand their architecture, functioning, and implications.

## Purpose

The main goal of this repository is to provide a hands-on learning experience for individuals interested in cybersecurity, particularly in the area of DDoS attacks and botnet structures. Through this repository, you will explore:

- How DDoS botnets operate
- Components and architecture of a DDoS botnet
- Techniques used in DDoS attacks
- Defensive strategies to mitigate DDoS attacks

## Disclaimer

This repository is intended solely for educational and research purposes. The code and materials provided here are for learning purposes only. Any misuse of the information or code contained in this repository for illegal activities or unethical behavior is strictly prohibited.

**I am not responsible for any misuse of the content provided in this repository.**

You are free to clone, fork, and modify the code in this repository for educational purposes. However, please adhere to the following guidelines:

- Use the code and materials responsibly and ethically.
- Do not engage in any activities that violate laws or regulations.
- Do not use the code for malicious purposes or to harm others.

 ## Folder Structure and Files

This repository is organized with the following folder structure:

- **deps/**: This directory contains the dependency scripts for the botnet, including the client and server applications, as well as the file to be executed on the clients.
  - `client.py`: The client application responsible for receiving commands from the server and executing them.
  - `server.py`: The server application responsible for orchestrating the botnet and sending commands to the clients.
  - `file.py`: The Python script to be executed on the clients upon receiving commands from the server.

- **README.md**: This file provides an overview of the repository, including its purpose, usage guidelines, disclaimer, and other relevant information.

- **LICENSE**: This file contains the MIT License, which governs the use and distribution of the code in this repository.

- **__init__.py**: This file initializes the repository and orchestrates the execution of the client and server applications.

The interaction between the components of the botnet is as follows:
1. `init.py` run ups the `clients` and following that the `server` as well.
2. The server application (`server.py`) sends commands to the client applications (`client.py`) instructing them to fetch and execute the `file.py` script.
3. Upon receiving commands from the server, the client applications fetch the `file.py` script from the server and execute it locally.
4. The `file.py` script carries out the desired actions on the client machine, simulating the behavior of a botnet.

Please refer to the individual files for detailed comments and documentation on their functionality and usage.
